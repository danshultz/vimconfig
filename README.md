In order to use the vim-ruby gem to it's fullest potential vim needs to be installed with ruby support. You could use mac vim but I prefer terminal vim. The following commands will compile terminal vim with ruby support.

* run "easy_install mercurial" (this is necessary at least until vim moves over to github)
* run "brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb" to compile vim with ruby support
